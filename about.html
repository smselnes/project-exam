        <h1>How it all started</h1>
        <p>
          Traveling across borders to see new places or countries was totally
          unknown to me as a youngster. I heard about schoolmates going to
          mediterranean areas with their families in holidays, staying at fancy
          hotels where you could have something called all inclusive and eat as
          much food you wanted, or having as much soda or ice cream your
          stommach could handle.
        </p>

        <h2>Inspired by grandma</h2>
        <p>
          Going into my teenages, I built an even stronger relationship to my
          beloved grandma. We were already very close, but as she lived as close
          to the school as you could possibly do, it was natural to eat dinner
          or just drop by after school often.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since my grandpa died when I was around 6 years old and she eventually
          becoming a pensionist, she developed new interests. One of this was
          exploring a bit out of Norway, so she joined arranged travel groups
          with other people in same situation. From all around the country. This
          way she created friendly relationships which lasted for years. Or they
          faded slowly away as she later on got a dementia diagnose. Sadly.
        </p>
        <h2>New friendships inspires</h2>
        <p>
          Finishing high school, highly demotivated from studies i accidently
          got an offer I couldnt refuse, being offered a full time job as a
          cook. This was about 900km away from my hometown, but since I had no
          specific plans it was a no-brainer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Being settled down in city of Tønsberg, working long and busy days
          with good colleagues, my social network expanded quickly. Some of them
          worked as much as they could through most of the year, saving money to
          spend on traveling around in the world. This triggered something in
          me, and after about a year I decided to make an application to a folk
          high school to study tourism.
        </p>
        <p>
          I packed my bags and went moving to the school located in a very small
          town called Lena to meet up with my new student friends.
        </p>
        <h2>Studying tourism</h2>
        <p>
          Getting started on the year of tourism, I quickly realized this was
          perfect match for me. Throughout the year we traveled multiple times
          to different destinations. We practiced on being tour guides, both for
          our fellow students and also for unknown people, being on a trip. It
          could be buses, boats, trains and while walking at the destination.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          A fantastic educational year it was. I got friends for life during the
          year, which I speak to and meet regularly still today, over 15 years
          after. I also established contacts within the travel industry. I
          actually had an direct offer to go work as a cook for 6 months in
          Turkey straight after school. I didnt take the offer, but Its cool to
          think about what turn my life would take if I did. No regrets though.
        </p>
        <h2>Its all about traveling now</h2>
        <p>
          The following years it was pretty much all about hard work in the
          restaurant back in Tønsberg. Saving money. Spending money. Traveling
          with friends. Festivals and concerts here and there every summer.
          Roskilde-festival in Denmark was a must in July annually.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          I moved into an apartment with one of my best friends during this
          period. We shared some interests, and he adapted my interest of
          traveling. What we didnt know at the time, our lives would soon take
          turns into other interests. Going from non-serious relationships with
          women, we both were soon in serious relationships with our
          girlfriends. We even declined an offer to go working and living in
          Canary Islands, where they had jobs, apartment and a car available.
          Well, I've always liked how coincidences have brought us to where we
          are today.
        </p>
        <h2>Not only for the parties anymore</h2>
        <p>
          After meeting my girlfriend we quickly merge the interest of seeing
          new places. Exploring together and having equal priorities and points
          of interest on a trip is so valuable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, as my daughter has started on school, I try to share some
          interest both in geography and learning about other countries. She was
          given a globe with pink light inside from one of her uncles, and she
          loves pointing somewhere on it, so we can google the place and see
          pictures from there. She also enjoy "driving" at the place on Google
          Maps.
